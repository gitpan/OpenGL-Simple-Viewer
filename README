OpenGL::Simple::Viewer version 0.01
====================================

This module uses OpenGL::Simple and OpenGL::Simple::GLUT to provide a
quick and simple geometry viewer. If you just want to view a single
biomolecule, or throw some polygons at the screen and make sure they
come out looking OK, then this module might be for you. If you want to
write a first-person-shooter or comprehensive visualization toolkit,
this module is probably not for you.

You should not have to worry about quaternion algebra or any of the
subtleties of how to represent 3D rotations unless you really want to;
the module attempts to take care of all of this for you.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
